# Because this Service has no selector, the corresponding Endpoint object is not created automatically.
# You can manually map the Service to the network address and port where itâ€™s running,
# by adding an Endpoint object manually:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: customendpoint
  namespace: default
subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: 192.168.11.92
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
